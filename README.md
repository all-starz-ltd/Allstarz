# All-Starz_ltd â€” Static Site (Glitch Rock / Loâ€‘Fi)

This is a static website (HTML/CSS/JS) for **All-Starz_ltd** with:
- Home hero + label tagline
- Shop (vinyl, cassette, CD, Tâ€‘shirt) with **PayPal buy links** (free to use)
- Music / tracklist section
- Producer-for-hire services
- Events
- About + socials
- Contact form (mailto by default)

## How to use
1. Host these files anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, OVH static hosting).
2. Replace the placeholder PayPal links in `index.html` with your **hosted button** URLs:
   - Create a free PayPal Business account â†’ Pay & Get Paid â†’ PayPal Buttons â†’ Buy Now â†’ copy the button link.
3. Replace the album links (Spotify, Bandcamp) with your real URLs.
4. Update dates, services, and prices to your needs.

## Optional improvements (still free)
- Use **Formspree** or **Netlify Forms** for the contact form (no backend needed).
- Use **Gumroad** product links instead of PayPal if you prefer.
- Add analytics (Plausible/GoatCounter) for privacy-friendly stats.

## Dev
- Edit styles in `styles.css` (glitch / noise / scanlines).
- Images are in `/assets` as SVG placeholders.
